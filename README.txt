a) Why did you choose the medium you chose?
b) What did you know about the medium when you chose it?
c) What are all the resources (web pages, tutorials, videos, etc.) that you used to help you?
d) What was the most challenging part of the assignment, and how did you overcome it?

a. I chose morris.js because I'm interested in data visualization on web apps, and Morris.js is one of the useful, light weighted charting library with a relative shallow learning curve.

b. Previously during work, I have tried some charting library including flot.js, chart.js and d3.js. Morris.js was in my considerations but later was excluded due to some user requirements. I knew that Morris.js is very similar to chart.js and flot.js, which include almost all the charting forms I need.

c. Basically the Morris.js official website http://morrisjs.github.io/morris.js/index.html is all that I need for drawing all types of charts. Aside from that I also googled some specific problems such as the chart was not shown fully on the webpage, and solved them following the answers from online forums(mainly from stackoverflow.com) .
Other than the charting part, I also used some bootstrap code from getbootstrap.com and the original charting memes from google images.

d. The most challenging part of the assignment is to edit some of the label format, such as adding postfix to data, because it includes functions. If something is wrong in the functions, the chart would just disappear, instead of showing error messages of the incorrected lines. And sometimes I was confused whether the chart was not showing correctly because something is wrong in my code, or it was just impractical to implement the results I needed using the current library. Eventually I overcame almost all the problems by googling for solutions and tried them on my project.
